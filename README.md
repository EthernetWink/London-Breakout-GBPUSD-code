# London-Breakout-GBPUSD-code

This code provides context for the London Breakout GBPUSD trade. The concept of this trade is that an individual would take the high and low of GBPUSD from midnight to 8am, as that represents the Tokyo session. Then, breaks above the highs are long signals and below the lows are short signals. There is a "rule" I have not implemented which is that technically this trade doesn't occur after 9am. So 8am to 9am is the window. I have just left a user with the levels and highlighting the price. 

Hope you all enjoy.
